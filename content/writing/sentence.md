1. Identify the core of the sentence. Find the main clause (subject + verb).

   Ask these questions:
   - Who or what is doing something? → Subject
   - What are they doing or being? → Verb
   
   Cross out modifiers and side details until you see the skeleton.
   
   Example:
   
   After reviewing the data, the team concluded that the report was inaccurate.
   → Core: The team concluded.

2. Label parts of speech

   Mark each main word by role:
   
   Nouns → person, place, thing, idea
   
   Verbs → action or state
   
   Adjectives → describe nouns
   
   Adverbs → modify verbs, adjectives, or whole clauses
   
   Prepositions → show relationships (in, on, at, with)
   
   Conjunctions → connect parts (and, but, because)
   
   Articles → a, an, the
   
   Pronouns → he, she, it, they
   
   Example:
   
   After (prep) reviewing (verb) the (article) data (noun), the (article) team (noun) concluded (verb) that (conjunction) the (article) report (noun) was (verb) inaccurate (adj).
   
3. Analyze the sentence structure

   Identify:
   
   Main clause(s)
   
   Dependent clauses (starting with because, although, which, that, etc.)
   
   Phrases (prepositional, participial, infinitive)
   
   Diagram or bracket them to visualize hierarchy.
   
   Example:
   
   [After reviewing the data], [the team concluded] [that the report was inaccurate].
   
   “After reviewing the data” = dependent (prepositional + gerund phrase)
   
   “the team concluded” = main clause
   
   “that the report was inaccurate” = noun clause (object of “concluded”)

4. Check for clarity blockers

   Ask:
   
   Is the main idea buried under phrases or modifiers?
   
   Are there ambiguous references (e.g., “it,” “this”)?
   
   Are modifiers dangling or misplaced?
   
   Are there unnecessary words?

5. Simplify and rephrase for clarity

   Use these principles:
   
   Put subject and verb close together.
   
   Replace abstract nouns with active verbs.
   
   Use specific words over vague ones.
   
   Split long sentences if they contain multiple ideas.
   
   Before:
   
   After reviewing the data, it was concluded by the team that the report was inaccurate.
   Problems: passive voice, “it” lacks a clear referent.
   
   After:
   
   The team concluded that the report was inaccurate after reviewing the data.

6. Read it aloud

   If it sounds awkward, unclear, or overly long, revise again. Your ear catches what your eye misses.
   
## Optional Deep Analysis

If you want to fully understand how a sentence works, go one level deeper:

Parse it (syntax tree or clause map)

Identify sentence type (simple, compound, complex, compound-complex)

Identify tone (formal/informal), register, and flow

## Practice Workflow

Write or select a sentence.

Strip it to its subject and verb.

Label every word by part of speech.

Draw brackets for each phrase/clause.

Identify where meaning could be sharper.

Rewrite, prioritizing:

Directness

Logical order

Smooth rhythm
