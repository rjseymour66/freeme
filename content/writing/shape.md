Follow these rules, and your sentence will not be shapeless:
- Place the point near the beginning
- Get to the verb in the main clause quickly
- Do not tack on phrases and subordinate clauses after the verb
- Do not interrupt the flow too often

## Starting with your point

Begin with a short, concrete subject directly followed by a verb that states a specific action. The beginning should be short and direct, and it should frame the more complex information at the end of the sentence. This is true both grammatically and logically---the beginning is the point (short and direct), and what follows is the supporting information (complex).

## How to revise: openings

When you have a long opening, readers realize that they are taking in a lot of information and have not yet reached the main clause. 

{{< admonition "Main point" tip >}}
Follow these rules:
1. Get to the subject of the main clause quickly.
2. Get to the verb and its object quickly.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Get to the subject

If there is a long clause at the beginning, try moving it to the end of the sentence or making it a sentence of its own. Clauses that begin with these words usually convey known information, so keep them short when you use them:
- If
- Since
- When
- Although

### Get to the verb and object

#### Avoid long, abstract subjects

First, underline the whole subject, then look at the first seven or eight words for these:

Nominalizations
: Make it into a verb and use a character as its subject.

  The school's policing of the underclassman was a cause for concern. 
  
  The school caused concern because it policed its underclassmen.

Relative clauses
: These can make a subject too long. Turn them into an introductory subordinate clause with "when" or "if".
  A person that focuses on the wrong things wastes time.
  
  When a person focuses on the wrong things, they waste time.

Long intro clause
: Try moving it to the end:
  A **person** that focuses on the wrong things _wastes_ time.
  
  When a person focuses on the wrong things, **they** _waste_ time.

  A **person** _wastes_ time when they focus on the wrong things.


#### Avoid interrupting the subject-verb connection

Move any interruption to the beginning or end of the sentence, depending on which part of the sentence it connects with best:
- Some **baseball players**, _particularly the younger ones with little experience_, **do not handle** the media well.
  
  Since some baseball players **are young and inexperienced**, **they do not handle** the media well.

  Some **baseball players do not handle** the media well because _they are young and inexperienced_.

#### Avoid interrupting the verb-object connection

Move any interruption to the beginning or the end, depending on where it fits best
: Baseball players must, _if they want to have a successful career_, train in the offseason.
  
  Baseball players must train in the offseason _if they want to have a successful career_.

Short prepositional phrases
: If the prepositional phrase is shorter than a long object, you can place it between the verb and object:
  
  When you revise your writing, spend the most and most efficient amount of time on drafting _at the start_.

  When you revise your writing, spend _at the start_ the most and most efficient amount of time on drafting.
