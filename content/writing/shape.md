Follow these rules, and your sentence will not be shapeless:
- Place the point near the beginning
- Get to the verb in the main clause quickly
- Do not tack on phrases and subordinate clauses after the verb
- Do not interrupt the flow too often

## Starting with your point

Begin with a short, concrete subject directly followed by a verb that states a specific action. The beginning should be short and direct, and it should frame the more complex information at the end of the sentence. This is true both grammatically and logically---the beginning is the point (short and direct), and what follows is the supporting information (complex).

## How to revise: openings

When you have a long opening, readers realize that they are taking in a lot of information and have not yet reached the main clause. 

{{< admonition "Main point" tip >}}
Follow these rules:
1. Get to the subject of the main clause quickly.
2. Get to the verb and its object quickly.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Get to the subject

If there is a long clause at the beginning, try moving it to the end of the sentence or making it a sentence of its own. Clauses that begin with these words usually convey known information, so keep them short when you use them:
- If
- Since
- When
- Although

### Get to the verb and object

#### Avoid long, abstract subjects

First, underline the whole subject, then look at the first seven or eight words for these:

Nominalizations
: Make it into a verb and use a character as its subject.

  The school's policing of the underclassman was a cause for concern. 
  
  The school caused concern because it policed its underclassmen.

Relative clauses
: These can make a subject too long. Turn them into an introductory subordinate clause with "when" or "if".
  A person that focuses on the wrong things wastes time.
  
  When a person focuses on the wrong things, they waste time.

Long intro clause
: Try moving it to the end:
  A **person** that focuses on the wrong things _wastes_ time.
  
  When a person focuses on the wrong things, **they** _waste_ time.

  A **person** _wastes_ time when they focus on the wrong things.


#### Avoid interrupting the subject-verb connection

Move any interruption to the beginning or end of the sentence, depending on which part of the sentence it connects with best:
- Some **baseball players**, _particularly the younger ones with little experience_, **do not handle** the media well.
  
  Since some baseball players **are young and inexperienced**, **they do not handle** the media well.

  Some **baseball players do not handle** the media well because _they are young and inexperienced_.

#### Avoid interrupting the verb-object connection

Move any interruption to the beginning or the end, depending on where it fits best
: Baseball players must, _if they want to have a successful career_, train in the offseason.
  
  Baseball players must train in the offseason _if they want to have a successful career_.

Short prepositional phrases
: If the prepositional phrase is shorter than a long object, you can place it between the verb and object:
  
  When you revise your writing, spend the most and most efficient amount of time on drafting _at the start_.

  When you revise your writing, spend _at the start_ the most and most efficient amount of time on drafting.


## How to revise: endings

If your sentence has endings with multiple relative clauses, try these methods.


Cut
: Delete "who/that/which" + "is/was", etc, to reduce the number of relative clauses. This sometimes requires that you turn verbs into the present participle by adding "-ing":

Turn subordinate clauses into independent sentences
: Just cut the long sentence into multiple sentences.

Change clauses to modifying phrases
: There are three kinds of modifiers:
  - Resumptive: A grammatical construction that repeats a key word at the end of a clause and then uses that repetition to introduce a new, elaborating phrase or clause.
    
    To create resumptive modifier:
    1. Find the noun that the tacked-on clause modifies
    2. Pause with a comma
    3. Repeat the noun
    4. Continue with a restrictive relative clause beginning with _that_.
    
    He should have apologized after his last mistake, a mistake that made everyone leave the dinner early.

  - Summative: A construction that adds a term that sums up the sentence to that point.

    To create a summative modifier:
    1. End a grammatically complete segment of a sentence with a comma
    2. Add a term that sums up the substance of the sentence so far.
    3. Continue with a restrictive relative clause beginning with _that_.

    He should have apologized after his last mistake, a missed opportunity that he will regret for some time.
    
  - Free: This comments on the subject of the closest verb. It is "free" because it can begin or end a sentence.
    
    To create a free modifier:
    1. End a grammatically complete segment of a sentence with a comma
    2. Add a present or past participle, or an adjective.
    3. Continue with a restrictive relative clause.

    He should have apologized after his last mistake, begging for forgiveness from his wife.


## Dangling modifiers

A dangling modifier occurs when a modifier's implied subject is different from the subject in the main clause. Fix it with one of these methods:
- If the modifier has an implied subject, name the subject to make it explicit.
- Make the implict subject of the modifier the explicit subject of the clause.

### Common patterns


“After…” phrases
: After reading the book, the movie was disappointing. → After reading the book, I found the movie disappointing.

“Having…” phrases
: Having finished dinner, the dishes were washed. → Having finished dinner, we washed the dishes.

“To…” infinitive phrases
: To improve performance, the code was rewritten. → To improve performance, the developer rewrote the code.

| Step | What to check                                                    | Example                                                  | Fix                                                               |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Does the opening phrase describe the subject of the main clause? | *Running down the street, the backpack fell off.*        | Add subject: *Running down the street, I dropped my backpack.*    |
| 2    | Is the modifier too far from the word it describes?              | *She served sandwiches to the children on paper plates.* | Move words: *She served the children sandwiches on paper plates.* |
| 3    | Can you rewrite the phrase as a clause?                          | *While walking to the store, a dog barked loudly.*       | *While I was walking to the store, a dog barked loudly.*          |
