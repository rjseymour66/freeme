To be able to understand how your readers feel about your writing, you need to know what counts as a well-told story.

## Characters and actions

A story is an account of real or imagined events with _characters_ that do things---perform _actions_.

### Rule 1: Subjects

Make the main characters the subject of the sentence. This will show you whether you are telling a story with the correct characters:
1. Find the verb
2. Put either "who" or "what" in front of the verb to figure out who is performing the action of the verb. If this reveals that the verb does not point to a main character, you need to revise. For example:
   
   Wrong
   : `The barking starts during commercials.` _What_ starts? Barking. **This is not a character!**  
   
   Correct
   : `The dog barks during commercials.` _Who_ barked during commercials? The dog.
