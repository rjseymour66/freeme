To be able to understand how your readers feel about your writing, you need to know what counts as a well-told story. This means finding the correct subject and verbs---characters and actions. Finding the correct characters and actions means transforming nominalizations into verbs and finding the correct subject. This provides the following results for your sentences:
- They are more concrete.
- They are more concise because you do not have to use prepositional phrases.
- They are more logical and clear. You can link clauses with clear subordinating conjunctions, such as _because_, _although_, and _if_.
- They tell more coherent stories. Nominalizations let you distort the sequence of events.

## Characters and actions

A story is an account of real or imagined events with _characters_ that do things---perform _actions_.

### Rule 1: Subjects

Make the main characters the subject of the sentence. This will show you whether you are telling a story with the correct characters:
1. Find the verb
2. Put either "who" or "what" in front of the verb to figure out who is performing the action of the verb. If this reveals that the verb does not point to a main character, you need to revise. For example:
   
   Wrong
   : `The barking starts during commercials.` _What_ starts? Barking. **This is not a character!**  
   
   Correct
   : `The dog barks during commercials.` _Who_ barked during commercials? The dog.

### Rule 2: Make actions verbs

Do not use vague verbs or nominalizations. Verbs should name important story actions:

Wrong
: The thought _occurred_ to me that I should leave early.

Correct
: I _think_ I should leave early.

## How to revise

### Analyze

Ignore introductory phrases and underline the first eight or so words in the sentence. Ask yourself these questions:
- Did you underline any abstract nouns as the simple subject?
- Did you underline eight words before you got to a verb?

### Assess

1. Determine who the main characters are.
2. Look for the actions that the characters perform. Look especially for nominalizations.

### Rewrite

1. Convert nominalizations into verbs.
2. Make your characters the subjects of those verbs.

## Patterns

{{< admonition "Fitting clauses together" tip >}}
Complicated sentences often have multiple character-action clauses. After you decide how the clauses fit together, try one of these patterns:
- X _because_ Y.
- _Because_/_Since_ X, Y.
- _Although_ X, Y.
- X _and_/_but_/_so_ Y.

### Subject of empty verb

The nominalization is the subject of an empty verb such as a form of _be_, _seems_, _has_:

The _intention_ of the committee **is** to audit the records.

1. Change the nominalization to a verb.  
2. Find the character that can be the subject of the verb.
3. Make that character the subject of the new verb.

The committee intends to audit the records.

### Follows empty verb

The agency **conducted** an _investigation_ into the matter.

1. Change the nominalization to a verb.
   
   _investigation_ > _investigate_
2. Replace the empty verb with the new verb.
   
   The agency investigated the matter.


### Subject of empty verb followed by nominalization

Our _loss_ in sales **was** a result of their _expansion_ of outlets.

1. Change the nominalization to a verb.
   
   _loss_ > _loss_  
   
   _expansion_ > _expand_
2. Find the character that can be the subject of the verb.
   
   Our loss

   they expanded
3. Link the clauses with a logical connector:
   - simple cause: because, since, when
   - conditional cause: if, provided that, so long as
   - contradict expected clause: though, although, less
   
   We _lost_ sales BECAUSE they _expanded_ outlets.

### There is/there are

There is no **need** for our further **study** of this problem.


1. Change the nominalization to a verb.
   
   _need_ > _need_

   _study_ > _study_
2. Find the character that can be the subject of the verb.
   
   We _need_

   We _study_
3. Make that character the subject of the verb.
   
   We _need_ not _study_ this problem further.


### Nominalizations joined by prepositions

We did a **review** of the **evolution** of the brain.

1. Change the first nominalization to a verb.
2. For the second nominalization, do one of the following:
   - Leave it as is: 
     
     We _reviewed_ the _evolution_ of the brain.
   - Change it to a verb in a _how_ or _why_ clause.
     
     We _reviewed_ [_how the brain_] evolves.

## Useful nominalizations

### Refers to previous sentence

You can use a nominalization when it links the current sentence to the previous sentence:

Kubernetes _automates_ repetitive administrative tasks. _This automation_ frees you to complete other work.

### Replaces "The fact that"

**The fact that** you _intended_ to hurt her feelings is baffling.

Your _intentions_ are baffling.


### Names object of verb

I accepted what she _decided_.

I accepted her _decision_.

### Familiar concepts

Some nominalizations are so familiar you can use them without causing issues:

The software _installation_ process takes about 5 minutes.
