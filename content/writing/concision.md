Writing concisely means using just enough words to say what you mean.

## How to revise

There are six principles to write concisely.

### Delete meaningless words

Some examples:
- kind of
- actually
- particular
- really
- certain
- various
- virtually
- individual
- basically
- generally
- given
- practically

### Delete doubled words

Doubled words began when writers paired a French or Latin word with an English word to sound smarter. Just pick one:
- hope and desire -> hope
- each and every -> each
- any and all -> all

### Delete what readers can infer

#### Redundant modifiers

When the meaning of the word is implied by its modifier:
- _future_ plans
- _free_ gift
- _basic_ fundamentals

#### Redundant categories

When the word implies its general category:
- period of time -> period
- blue in color -> blue
- rough in appearance -> rough
- large in size -> large
- in a confused state -> confused

You might have to change an adjective into an adverb:
- He gave a quick answer. -> He answered _quickly_.

Or change an adjective into a noun:
- He began another vocational endeavor. -> Be began another _vocation_.


### Replace a phrase with a word

Examples:
- the reason for -> why
- concerning the manner -> about

### Change negatives with affirmatives

Some words are implicitly negative. Do not pair these with _not_:

Verbs
: - preclude
  - prevent
  - lack
  - fail
  - doubt
  - reject
  - avoid
  - deny
  - refuse
  - exclude
  - contradict
  - prohibit
  - bar

Prepositions
: - without
  - against
  - lacking
  - but for
  - except

Conjunctions
: - unless
  - except when

Negatives require more words and more mental work:
- not the same -> different
- not include -> omit
- not often -> rarely

Do not combine negative words with passive verbs and nominalizations:
- There should be no confusion for the user without extra steps, unless the time does not exceed five minutes.
- Do not confuse the user with extra steps, unless it takes longer than five minutes.

### Delete adjectives and adverbs

Always try to delete every adverb and adjective before a noun, then restore only those that the readers need to understand the passage.


## Hedges

_Hedges_ qualify your certainty. Don't hedge too much. Some common hedges:

Adverbs
: - usually
  - often
  - sometimes
  - almost
  - virtually
  - possibly
  - allegedly
  - arguably
  - perhaps
  - apparently
  - in some ways
  - to a certain extent
  - somewhat
  - in some/certain respects

Adjectives
: - most 
  - many
  - some
  - a certain number of

Verbs
: - may
  - might
  - can
  - could
  - seem
  - tend
  - appear
  - suggest
  - indicate

## Intensifiers

_Intensifiers_ increase your certainty. Don't use intensifiers excessively---state your claims moderately.

Some examples of intensifiers:

Adverbs
: - very
  - pretty
  - quite
  - rather
  - clearly
  - obviously
  - undoubtedly
  - certainly
  - of course
  - indeed
  - inevitably
  - invariably
  - always
  - literally

Adjectives
: - key 
  - central
  - crucial
  - basic
  - fundamental
  - major
  - principal
  - essential

Verbs
: - show
  - prove
  - establish
  - as you can see
  - it is clear that

1. There may always be TV programming to appeal to lowest interests.
2. We might need to dispense with the standard approach to plea bargaining because hardened criminals might avoid their just punishment and plea bargaining encourages disrespect to the judicial system.
3. Depending on one's position, education might be a more important source of social values than the family.
