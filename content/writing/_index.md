## Five major principles
Characters as subjects
: Use main characters in your "story" as the subjects of most of your sentences.

Actions as verbs
: Express the main actions performed by or on the characters as verbs.

Old before new
: Begin sentences with familiar information and end with information readers cannot predict.

Short before long
: Begin with a short, easily grasped segment of information that frames the longer, more complex segments that follow. This applies to sentences, paragraphs, sections, and entire documents.

Topic then stress
: Begin sentences with what they are about or comment on, then end with words that should receive special emphasis.


You write more clearly when you do the following:
- Match characters and actions to subjects and verbs
- Get the right cahracters into topics
- Stress the right words
- Motivate readers with well-crafted introductions
- Frame your paragraphs, sections, and documents to help readers grasp global coherence
- Be concise
