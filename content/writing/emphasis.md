## Simplicity to complexity

{{< admonition "" note >}}
The sentence should open with a short segment that readers can easily grasp and that frames the more complex information that follows.
{{< /admonition >}}

Placing your subject/character and verb/action at the beginning of the sentence makes it easier for the reader to understand complex information at the end of the sentence. If the reader gets through the character and action in a few words, they have enough momentum to carry them through the remainder of the sentence.

Readers want you to organize your sentences so they can manage two types of difficulty:
- long and complex phrases and clauses
- new information, such as technical terms

Start your sentences with relatively short sentences:
- (Optional) short introductory phrase or clause
- Short, concrete subject
- Verb expressing a specific action

This sets your reader up to handle the remainder of the sentence, which may stretch for several lines.

## Emphasis and stress

The end of the sentence is not only unfamiiar and more complex, but it receives the most stress. Readers naturally stress the end of the sentence, so make sure you end the sentence with significant words that you want to sound loud to their mind's ear. Otherwise, a sentence that ends with the wrong words is weak.

## How to revise stress

To test your sentence for stress, tap your fingers on the table as you read the last three or four words. If the words do not deserve strong emphasis, revise.

### Trim the end

The sentence might end with words that repeat a previous word or just aren't necessary:

- Teachers claim that students do not possess good social skills _with other students_.
- Teachers claim that students do not possess _good social skills_.

### Shift peripheral ideas left

If a sentence ends with a weak phrase or metadiscourse, move it left:
- Hide your phone, _if necessary_.
- If necessary, _hide your phone_.

### Shift new information right

New information should always come at the end of the sentence:

- Musicians improvise melodies with chord scales. Harmonic minor is a _difficult scale to understand_.
- Musicians improvise melodies with chord scales. A scale that is difficult to understand is the _harmonic minor_.

## Devices to emphasize the right words

These devices help you manipulate the stress in a sentence.

### _There_ shift

There are mixed opinions about this device, but many writers begin a paragraph with "There are/is" to introduce new topics and concepts. You can also use it to shift new information to the right:

- Groups like gamblers anonymous help you stop gambling.
- _There are_ groups like gamblers anonymous help you stop gambling.

### Passives

A passive verb lets you flip a subject and object so you can put new information later in the sentence:

- Gamblers behave according to the context. The pot influences their demeanor.
- Gamblers behave according to the context. Their demeanor _is influenced_ by the pot.

### _What_ shift

Similar to the _There_ shift, this device shifts information to the right and adds emphasis:

- We need a new refrigerator.
- What we need _is_ a new refrigerator.

### _It_ shift

When a sentence begins with a long noun clause, move the clause to the end of the sentence and start it with _It_:

- A rookie pitcher throwing a no-hitter _was unbelievable_.
- **It** was unbelievable that a _rookie pitcher threw a no-hitter_.

### Not only X, but Y as well

The word "but" can emphasize the last element of a pair:

- You must create _safe passwords and store them in a secure location_.
- You must not only create safe passwords **but also** _store them in a secure location_.

### Pronoun substitution

Replace a word or words with a pronoun so you don't repeat a word at the end of a sentence. When you repeat a word at the end, the end of the sentence loses its power.


### Topics, stress, themes, and coherence

After you find your topics, signal the passage's key concepts in the stress position of its opening sentence. This makes the passage more coherent.
