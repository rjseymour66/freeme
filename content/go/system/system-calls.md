System calls ("syscalls") are the interface between user-level programs and the operating system kernel. System calls are made through the system call API, a collection of low-level functions provided by the OS kernel to provide user mode processes to request services from the kernel.

Find Linux syscalls with the [searchable syscall table](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/).

## x/sys package

The `syscall` package became so bloated and unwieldly that it is no longer maintained. Now, all syscall functions are available in the `x/sys` and `os` packages.

{{< admonition "Prefer the `os` package" tip >}}
For most tasks, you want to use the `os` package. Use `x/sys` only when you need fine-grained control over system calls for the specific OS.

You have to download the `x/sys` package:

```bash
go get -u golang.org/x/sys
```

## os package
