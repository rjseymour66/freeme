Go includes built-in testing tools for functional and performance testing.

Unit testing
: Checks code in individual functions or modules.

Integration testing
: Verifies that different modules work well together.

Functional testing
: Verifies the correctness of the program output.

Test suite
: Collection of test cases. If you use testing resources, set up the resources at the start of the test suite, then tear them down at the end.

## Conventions

All Go tests must follow these conventions:
- All test files must end in `_test.go`, which lets the Go test tool identify them.
- Each test function must start with `TestXxx`, with the remainder of the name in camel case.
- A test function takes a single argument, a pointer to `testing.T`. `T` is a struct with testing methods that manages test state and can log test results.

### File location

Place test files in the same package as the code that they test.
  ```bash
  project-root
  ├── go.mod
  ├── main.go
  └── packagename
      ├── functional.go         # source code
      └── testing_test.go       # test file
  ```
### External tests

For external (integration) tests, use the original package name followed by `_test`. For example:
```go
package original_test
```
This package format requires that you import the source into the test file.



## Writing tests

Each test contain three main phases:

1. Arrange: Set up the test inputs and expected values:
   ```go
   a := 2, b := 3
   ```
2. Act: Execute the code that you are testing:
   ```go
   got := Add(a, b), want := 5
   ```
3. Assert: Verify that the code returns the correct values. You can use the `got`/`want` or `got`/`expected` semantics:
   ```go
   if got != want { ... }
   ```

| Phase   | Purpose                                                                                                      | Example                       |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| Arrange | Set up the test inputs and expected values.                                                                  | `a := 2`, `b := 3`            |
| Act     | Execute the code that you are testing.                                                                       | `got := Add(a, b), want := 5` |
| Assert  | Verify that the code returns the correct values. You can use the `got`/`want` or `got`/`expected` semantics. | `if got != want { ... }`      |



### Single test

Run a single test to validate one specific behavior of a function. The three phases are shown in comments because single tests are usually simple:

```go
func TestParse(t *testing.T) {
	
    const uri = "https://github.com/username"                       // 1. Arrange

	got, err := Parse(uri)                                          // 2. Act
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Parse (%q) err = %q, want <nil>", uri, err)
	}
	want := &URL{
		Scheme: "https",
		Host:   "github.com",
		Path:   "username",
	}

	if *got != *want {                                              // 3. Assert
		t.Errorf("Parse (%q)\ngot   %#v\nwant  %#v", uri, got, want)
	}
}
```

### Table test

Table tests separate the test data from the logic so you can reuse the logic for different test cases. Use a table test when you need to test multiple inputs.

#### Arrange

A common way to arrange a test is to use table tests. Table tests are a way to provide multiple test cases that you loop over and test during the `Act` stage. To set up a table test, complete the following:
1. Create a `testCase` struct that models the inputs and expected outputs of the test:
   ```go
   type testCase struct {
	   a        int
	   b        int
	   expected int
   }
   ```
   {{< admonition "`name` field" note >}}
   Table tests commonly use a `name` field so you can distinguish between tests. For more information, see [Unit testing: Subtests](../unit-testing#subtests).
   {{< /admonition >}}
2. Use a map literal with a `string` key and `testCase` value. The `string` key is the name of the test, and `testCase` is the test values:
   ```go
   tt := map[string]testCase{   // tt for table tests
        "test one": {
            a:        4,
            b:        5,
            expected: 9,
        },
        "test two": {
            a:        -4,
            b:        15,
            expected: 11,
        },
        "test three": {
            a:        5,
            b:        1,
            expected: 6,
        },
   }
   ```
#### Act

Within the same `TestAdd()` function, write a `for range` loop. This is where you execute each test case with the code that you are testing. Use the `t.Run()` subtest method in the `for range` loop to run each individual test case with a name. `t.Run()` accepts two parameters: the name of the test, and an unnamed test function:

```go
for name, tc := range tt {
	t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
		// act
		got := add(tc.a, tc.b)
		...
	})
}
```
In the previous example, `name` is the key in the `tt` map, and `tc` is the `testCase` struct in the `tt` map.

#### Assert

In the assert step, you compare the actual values (what you got in the Act step) with the expected value, which is usually a field in the `testCase` struct. Asserts are generally `if` statements that return a formatted error with `t.Errorf` when the `got` and `expected` values do not match:

```go
for name, tc := range tt {
	t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
        ...
		// assert
		if got != tc.expected {
			t.Errorf("expected %d, got %d", tc.expected, got)
		}
	})
}
```
#### Assert helper

Writing assert logic can get tedious, so you should extract it into a helper function. Add the following code to `/internal/assert/assert.go`:

```go
package assert

import (
    "testing"
)

func Equal[T comparable](t *testing.T, got, expected T) {
    t.Helper()

    if got != expected {
        t.Errorf("got: %v; want: %v", got, expected)
    }
}
```

The preceding example uses [generics](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/generics).

Now, you can use this helper function to verify test output during the assert stage:

```go
for name, tc := range tt {
	t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
        ...
		// assert
		assert.Equal(t, got, tc.expected)
	})
}
```

## Test commands

1. Verbose output.
2. Test results are cached, but this skips the cache and forces Go to rerun the test.
3. Add the `-shuffle=on` flag to execute tests in a random order. This command returns the "shuffling seed" number. You can use this to run tests in the same order. This is helpful if you have a bug and want to reproduce the tests until you fix the issue:
   ```bash
   go test -v -shuffle=on
   -test.shuffle 1769368631148682425
   ...
   ```
4. Stops tests in a single package if there is a failing test. This is helpful if you want to work on the first failing test.
5. Run a specific test.
6. Run a specific subtest.
7. Globbing syntax. This test runs a specific subtest that begins with `with_port`.
8. Use the short flag to skip long-running tests, like integration tests. The test function must use the `testing.Short()` function, and optionally use `t.Skip` to provide context for skipping the test.

```go
go test -v                              // 1
go test -count=1                        // 2
go test -v -shuffle=on                  // 3
go test -v -shuffle=1769368631148682425
go test -v -failfast                    // 4
go test -v -run=TestName                // 5
go test -v -run=TestName/with_port      // 6
go test -v -run=TestName/^with_port     // 7
go test -v -short ./...                 // 8
```

## Comparing structs

Comparing structs is not as straightforward as primitive types. You can use the `reflect` package, but the [`go-cmp` package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp) is easier. Run this command to download the package:

```bash
go get github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp
```

Here is an example of how to compare values:

```go
func TestParseWithoutPath(t *testing.T) {
	const uri = "https://github.com"

	got, err := Parse(uri)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Parse (%q) err = %q, want <nil>", uri, err)
	}
	want := &URL{
		Scheme: "https",
		Host:   "github.com",
		Path:   "",
	}

	if diff := cmp.Diff(want, got); diff != "" {
		t.Errorf("Parse(%q) mismatch (-want +got):\n%s", uri, diff)
	}
}
```

Here is the sample output:

```bash
go test -v .
=== RUN   TestParseWithoutPath
    url_test.go:45: Parse("https://github.com") mismatch (-want +got):
          &urlcopy.URL{
          	Scheme: "https",
          	Host:   "github.com",
        - 	Path:   "",
        + 	Path:   "username",
          }
...
```

## Failure messages

Test failure messages should be easy to read and show you how the test failed. Use `\n` and the correct format verbs: 

{{< admonition "Formatting verbs" tip >}}
If you use `%s`, `Errorf` calls the type's `String` method. Instead, use `%#v` to show exactly how the value is represented in code. Here are all versions of this format verb:

- `%v`: Default value format
- `%+v`: Include struct field names
- `%#v`: Go-syntax representation
{{< /admonition >}}

```go
got, err := Parse(uri)
if err != nil {
    t.Fatalf("Parse (%q) err = %q, want <nil>", uri, err)
}

if *got != *want {
	t.Errorf("Parse (%q)\ngot   %#v\nwant  %#v", uri, got, want)
}
```

## Log, Error, Fatal

t.Log
: You want to debug or show output but do not want to fail the test.

t.Error
: Something is wrong but the test can still keep running to collect more failures.

t.Fatal
: There’s no point continuing the test. For example, bad input, required init failed.

| Function    | Description                                                  | Use Case                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `t.Log`     | Prints debugging or informational output.                    | Show internal state or progress without failing the test.                  |
| `t.Logf`    | Prints formatted log output.                                 | Outputs formatted debugging output.                                        |
| `t.Error`   | Logs an error and marks the test as failed.                  | Something is wrong but the test can continue running.                      |
| `t.Errorf`  | Logs a formatted error message and marks the test as failed. | Need a detailed or formatted error message.                                |
| `t.Fail`    | Marks the test as failed without printing a message.         | Use in helper functions to mark failure without logging.                   |
| `t.FailNow` | Marks test as failed and immediately stops execution.        | When continuing the test is pointless (e.g., missing required test setup). |
| `t.Fatal`   | Logs a fatal error and stops the test immediately.           | When a critical issue prevents further execution.                          |
| `t.Fatalf`  | Same as `t.Fatal` but with formatting support.               | Outputs formatted fatal error messages.                                    |
